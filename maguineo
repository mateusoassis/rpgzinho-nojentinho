 Ancestry:
     Lucky - When you roll a 1 on an attack roll, ability check, or saving throw, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll.
     Brave - You have advantage on saving throws against being frightened.
     Halfling Nimbleness - You can move through the space of any creature that is of a size larger than yours.
     Stout Resilience - You have advantage on saving throws against poison, and you have resistance against poison damage.
 Class:
     Spellbook - You have a spellbook. Each time you gain a mage level you can write the spells you learn from that level into your spellbook without expending any sp, though you still must spend time writing them. Additionally, you can cast a spell in your spellbook as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and is from a theme you know.
     Arcane Tradition - School of Evocation: Fire, Ice ( Storm? precisa de +1 ) ----------------------------------------------------------
     Arcane Power - Power Source/Theme (force,forcebeam), Arcane Discoveries (magearmor,fire,2firecantrip,scorchray,2icecantrip,coneofcold), Mana/Energy
     Arcane Study - +1 Theme, escolhi Ice, precisa de Nature skill ( que já tenho ) pois é Primal
     Arcane Secrets - +2 spells de qualquer theme mesmo sem saber o theme ----------------------------------------------------------
     Arcane Inspiration ----------------------------------------------------------- You can call a spell to mind that suits your needs. On your turn with your spellbook in hand, you can cast a spell in your spellbook as if you know it. Once you use this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it again. lso, on a short rest you can choose a number of spells you know up to half your proficiency bonus (rounded down) and replace each of them with another spell in your spellbook from a theme you know, which must cost equal to, or less than, your energy limit. On a long rest you can choose and replace a number of spells equal to your proficiency bonus.
